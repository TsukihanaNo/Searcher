Searcher
========

Searcher is a search engine that works similar to Windows Search. With the release of windows 8, the search function on
windows have not been very robust. There were situations on linux where finding certain files were a pain. Thus this program
was started.

Searcher is written on python and therefore to make things fast, the program creates an archive of files on the system. This
archive should be generated once in a while to keep it up to date. This allows the program to do fast searches without having to constantly run through the system.


If you don't want a compiled version: Just clone the repo, and run either (full) Searcher.py or (lite) SearcherLite.py. Make sure you have python3 and the required libraries installed.

Requisites
=========
-Python 3+
-Qt 4.8

-PySide (pip install PySide)

-cx_freeze (if you want to make it into an executable program)
